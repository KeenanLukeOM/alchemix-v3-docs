Deposits of synthetic debt assets into the Transmuter create demand for underlying assets from AlchemistV3 instances, which are obligated to service that demand across a pre-set time period. This creates fixed-duration fixed-rate terms. Each Transmuter takes one synthetic debt asset (alAsset) and can be associated with multiple AlchemistV3 instances, however only one AlchemistV3 instance is used for redemptions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
