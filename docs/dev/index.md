# Dev Overview

This section of the docs will contain contract descriptions and architecture describing how Alchemix contracts work and interact on a technical level. These docs are in active development. Expect gaps and changes.

# Quick Start Guide

1. **Deposit to Earn & Borrow**

   Deposit your collateral into your preferred yield strategy to start earning interest, and be able to take out a loan. Use your deposit to borrow and receive alAssets while your deposit earns interest.

2. **Swap alAsset**

   Swap the alAsset to any other token via a DEX or DEX Aggregator to access the value of your loan. alAssets can also be used directly on some DeFi protocols.

3. **Wait, Withdraw, Borrow, Repay, or Self-Liquidate**

   Your chosen yield strategy will earn interest on the full initial deposit. When the chosen strategy earns yield, your share of the yield is used to repay your debt over time automatically. Manage your loan as needed, with the flexibility to withdraw principal, borrow more, repay, or self-liquidate at any time.
