# üç¥ Friendly Fork Initiative

TODO

Alchemix V3 is published under a Business Source License (BUSL) such that while the codebase is source available, any commercial deployment needs to be approved by the Alchemix Association.

Friendly forks catering for blockchain ecosystems that are not served by current Alchemix V3 deployments, or offer a significantly differentiated and novel version of V3 can apply for a BUSL license to fork Alchemix V3.

This framework enables teams to create a custom version of Alchemix V3, with yield strats and Alchemists that suit their blockchain ecosystem.

## What teams get from the friendly fork initiative:

- You will receive a BUSL license for 3 years, enabling the team to use Alchemix code for non-profit use. You cannot deploy the code on any chain where Alchemix V3 is already live.
- Direct support from the Alchemix core team.
- Marketing support from Alchemix social channels.
- The freedom to create their own custom version of V3, with different collateral assets, strategies and liquidity strategies.

## Programme Rules:

- Each friendly fork needs to go through the Alchemix association and obtain a BUSL license.
- Each friendly fork is required to audit any changes made to the Alchemix V3 codebase in their specific deployment.
- Each friendly fork mints their own synthetic assets and is responsible for their own liquidity management.

### Licensed Friendly Forks:
