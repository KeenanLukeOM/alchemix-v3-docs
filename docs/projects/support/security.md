# Security & Audits

<!-- TODO -->

At Alchemix, security is foundational. With every major protocol upgradeâ€”including Alchemix V3â€”we prioritize rigorous testing, independent audits, and transparent processes to protect users and partners alike.

### âœ… Audit Coverage

All core Alchemix V3 smart contracts have undergone comprehensive audits by top-tier security firms. These audits include:

- **Audit Firms:**

  - [Audit Firm 1] â€“ [Date]
  - [Audit Firm 2] â€“ [Date]
  - [Ongoing audit(s) or re-audits if applicable]

- **Audit Reports:**

  - [Link to Report 1]
  - [Link to Report 2]
  - [GitHub or IPFS mirror if preferred]

> _Note: We strongly recommend reviewing the latest reports for full technical details and findings._

### ðŸ§ª Internal Security Practices

In addition to third-party audits, Alchemix V3 benefits from internal security processes such as:

- **Extensive Testing:** Full unit test coverage and invariant testing suites.
- **Formal Verification:** Applied where appropriate for high-value components.
- **Code Reviews:** Multi-stage reviecope [here](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/alchemix/scope/#top).

### ðŸ”„ Upgradeability & Timelocks

- **Smart Contract Upgradeability:**  
  Key contracts may be upgradeable via governance. All upgradeable components are subject to multisig control and/or on-chain timelocks.
- **Timelock Details:**

  - Minimum delay: [X hours/days]
  - Managed by: [DAO multisig / Governance]

### ðŸ“¢ Ongoing Security

We continuously monitor and improve the protocol through:

- Regular re-audits for new features.
- Integration-specific reviews for ecosystem partners.
- Transparent disclosures and community engagement on risk.
