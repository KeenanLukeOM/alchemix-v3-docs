# Overview & Value Proposition

## What is Alchemix V3?

Alchemix V3 is a yield aggregation and self-repaying CDP platform that turns user collateral into a yield-bearing asset. It offers some of the best risk-adjusted yields in DeFi while enabling users to borrow against their collateral.

V3 introduces an enhanced Transmuter, providing a significantly stronger peg mechanism for alAssets. This unlocks new yield opportunities and fortifies the overall protocol.

Alchemix V3 is designed for anyone interested in generating yield in DeFi. Notable use cases include:

- **DAO Treasury Management** – Fund your runway without selling treasury assets.
- **Yield Farmers** – Access up to 10x leverage with no interest rates.
- **Liquidity Providers** – Eliminate impermanent loss on like-for-like alAsset pairs (e.g., `alETH<>frxETH`, `alUSD<>USDC`).

## Core Features

- One ERC-4626 (Alchemist) yield aggregation vault per asset per chain
- Meta Yield Token (MYT)
- Redemptions against debt positions
- 1:1 conversion of alAssets to MYT against the base asset
